        <p>RUwho is a service that allows for easier searching of the public Rutgers University people database. <u>RUwho is unaffiliated with Rutgers</u>.</p>
        <p>
            Designed to expand upon the official search platform; it's advantageous by returning results in real-time as a query is being entered alongside returning
            contact info of each match without the need to make multiple requests for every individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            The backend uses Flask and integrates with a FastAPI wrapper to fetch from the Rutgers DB. This project furthered my experience with
            Flask, HTML, JS, CSS (including media quieries), and CORS. This was my first time using FastAPI & SlowAPI, Waitress, Intersection Observers, New Relic (NRQL), and HTTPX (over Requests) and my first time using AJAX, localStorage, asyncio, and rate limiting in production.
        </p>
        <!--<p>A public API wrapper will be available at a later date.</p>-->

        <div id=stockscope-link style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.stockscope.net" target="_blank">StockScope.net</a></div>

        <p>StockScope is a real-time press release aggregator for listed companies publishing on prominent newswires. It's in active development and is <u>not production ready</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
            StockScope gathers releases from public newswire APIs, filters and categorizes them, and displays them in a central feed with the goal to provide investors a trading advantage without needing to constantly refresh multiple difficult-to-read streams. This service became a reality when I couldn't find any alternatives to the existing $50+/month news collector platforms and became a web app when others requested access to this tool.

            A Sanic backend is used to display data from a MongoDB database. This project expanded my experience with MongoDB, pymongo, HTML5, CSS, JS, cron, lxml, asyncio, and Python web frameworks. This was my first time using Sanic and websockets and my first time using webhooks, Google Analytics, session management, and an async framework in production.

        <p>bricks.deals is a Lego deal aggregator among leading US retailers. Sets are filtered to show only below-retail-price and in-stock deals available for purchase online. Expired deals and deal durations are visible as well.</p>

        <p>Deals can be sorted by various criteria and filtered by store and theme. This lightweight web app excludes the clutter present on these stores' individual sites in a concise and neat manner.</p>

        <p>A Flask backend is used to fetch data from a MongoDB database while a scheduling container periodically updates it. This weekend project advanced my experience with Flask, MongoDB, frontend web development, and manipulating API data. This was my first time using bs4 in production and MX records.</p>
